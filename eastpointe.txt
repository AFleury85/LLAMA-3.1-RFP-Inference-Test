Failure to maintain the required insurance does not limit this waiver.

This Section is not intended to and is not to be construed in any manner as waiving, restricting or limiting the liability of either party for any obligations under this Contract (including any provisions hereof requiring Contractor to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the City).

3. Staffing. The City’s Contract Administrator may require the Contractor to remove or reassign personnel by providing written notice to Contractor.

4. Independent Contractor. The Contractor is an independent contractor and assumes all rights, obligations and liabilities set forth in this Contract. The Contractor, its employees, and agents will not be considered employees of the City. No partnership or joint venture relationship is created by virtue of this Contract. The Contractor, and not the City, is responsible for the payment of wages, benefits and taxes of the Contractor’s employees and any subcontractors. Prior performance does not modify the Contractor’s status as an independent contractor.

5. Subcontracting. The Contractor may not delegate any of its obligations under the Contract without the prior written approval of the City. The Contractor must notify the City at least 90 calendar days before the proposed delegation and provide the City any information it requests to determine whether the delegation is in its best interest. If approved, the Contractor must: (a) be the sole point of contact regarding all contractual matters, including payment and charges for all Contract Activities; (b) make all payments to the subcontractor; and (c) incorporate the terms and conditions contained in this Contract in any subcontract with a subcontractor. The Contractor remains responsible for the completion of the Contract Activities, compliance with the terms of this Contract, and the acts and omissions of the subcontractor. The City, in its sole discretion, may require the replacement of any subcontractor.

6. Assignment. The Contractor may not assign this Contract to any other party without the prior approval of the City. Upon notice to the Contractor, the City, in its sole discretion, may assign in whole or in part, its rights or responsibilities under this Contract to any other party. If the City determines that a novation of the Contract to a third party is necessary, the Contractor will agree to the novation and provide all necessary documentation and signatures.

7. Stop Work Order. The City may suspend any or all activities under the Contract at any time. The City will provide the Contractor a written stop work order detailing the suspension. The Contractor must comply with the stop work order upon receipt. Within 90 calendar days, or any longer period agreed to by the Contractor, the City will either: (a) issue a notice authorizing Contractor to resume work, or (b) terminate the Contract or delivery order. The City will not pay for Contract Activities, the Contractor’s lost profits, or any additional compensation during a stop work period.

8. Termination for Cause. The City may terminate this Contract for cause, in whole or in part, if Contractor, as determined by the City: (a) endangers the value, integrity, or security of any location, data, or personnel; (b) becomes insolvent, petitions for bankruptcy court proceedings, or has an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding filed against it by any creditor; (c) engages in any conduct that may expose the City to liability; (d) breaches any of its material duties or obligations; or (e) fails to cure a breach within the time stated in a notice of breach. Any reference to specific breaches being material breaches within this Contract will not be construed to mean that other breaches are not material.

If the City terminates this Contract under this Section, the City will issue a termination notice specifying whether the Contractor must: (a) cease performance immediately, or (b) continue to perform for a specified period. If it is later determined that the Contractor was not in breach of the Contract, the termination will be deemed to have been a Termination for Convenience, effective as of the same date, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be limited to those provided in Section 24, Termination for Convenience.

The City will only pay for amounts due to the Contractor for Contract Activities accepted by the City on or before the date of termination, subject to the City’s right to set off any amounts owed by the Contractor for the City’s reasonable costs in terminating this Contract. The Contractor must pay all reasonable costs incurred by the City in terminating this Contract for cause, including administrative costs, attorneys’ fees, court costs, transition costs, and any costs the City incurs to procure the Contract Activities from other sources.

9. Termination for Convenience. The City may immediately terminate this Contract in whole or in part without penalty and for any reason, including but not limited to, appropriation or budget shortfalls. The termination notice will specify whether the Contractor must: (a) cease performance of the Contract Activities immediately, or (b) continue to perform the Contract Activities in accordance with Section 10, Transition Responsibilities. If the City terminates this Contract for convenience, the City will pay all reasonable costs, as determined by the City, for City approved Transition Responsibilities.

10. Transition Responsibilities. Upon termination or expiration of this Contract for any reason, the Contractor must, for a period of time specified by the City (not to exceed 90 calendar days), provide all reasonable transition assistance requested by the City, to allow for the expired or terminated portion of the Contract Activities to continue without interruption or adverse effect, and to facilitate the orderly transfer of such Contract Activities to the City or its designees. Such transition assistance may include, but is not limited to: (a) continuing to perform the Contract Activities at the established Contract rates; (b) taking all reasonable and necessary measures to transition performance of the work, including all applicable Contract Activities, training, equipment, software, leases, reports and other documentation, to the City or the City’s designee; (c) taking all necessary and appropriate steps, or such other action as the City may direct, to preserve, maintain, protect, or return to the City all materials, data, property, and confidential information provided directly or indirectly to Contractor by any entity, agent, vendor, or employee of the City; (d) transferring title in and delivering to the City, at the City’s discretion, all completed or partially completed deliverables prepared under this Contract as of the Contract termination date; and (e) preparing an accurate accounting from which the City and the Contractor may reconcile all outstanding accounts (collectively, “Transition Responsibilities”). This Contract will automatically be extended through the end of the transition period.

11. General Indemnification. The Contractor must defend, indemnify and hold the City, its departments, divisions, agencies, offices, commissions, officers, and employees harmless, without limitation, from and against any and all actions, claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, attorney fees, and expenses (including those required to establish the right to indemnification), arising out of or relating to: (a) any breach by the Contractor (or any of the Contractor’s employees, agents, subcontractors, or by anyone else for whose acts any of them may be liable) of any of the promises, agreements, representations, warranties, or insurance requirements contained in this Contract; (b) any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of any intellectual property right or other right of any third party; (c) any bodily injury, death, or damage to real or tangible personal property occurring wholly or in part due to action or inaction by the Contractor (or any of the Contractor’s employees, agents, subcontractors, or by anyone else for whose acts any of them may be liable); and (d) any acts or omissions of the Contractor (or any of the Contractor’s employees, agents, subcontractors, or by anyone else for whose acts any of them may be liable).

The City will notify the Contractor in writing if indemnification is sought; however, failure to do so will not relieve the Contractor, except to the extent that the Contractor is materially prejudiced. The Contractor must, to the satisfaction of the City, demonstrate its financial ability to carry out these obligations.

The City is entitled to: (i) regular updates on proceeding status; (ii) participate in the defense of the proceeding; (iii) employ its own counsel; and to (iv) retain control of the defense if the City deems necessary. The Contractor will not, without the City’s written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld), settle, compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any claim, action, or proceeding. To the extent that any City employee, official, or law may be involved or challenged, the City may, at its own expense, control the defense of that portion of the claim.

Any litigation activity on behalf of the City, or any of its subdivisions under this Section, must be coordinated with the Department of Law. An attorney designated to represent the City may not do so until approved by the Department of Law.

12. Disclosure of Litigation, or Other Proceeding. The Contractor must notify the City within 14 calendar days of receiving notice of any litigation, investigation, arbitration, or other proceeding (collectively, "Proceeding") involving the Contractor, a subcontractor, or an officer or director of the Contractor or subcontractor, that arises during the term of the Contract, including: (a) a criminal Proceeding; (b) a parole or probation Proceeding; (c) a Proceeding under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; (d) a civil Proceeding involving: (1) a claim that might reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Contractor’s viability or financial stability; or (2) a governmental or public entity’s claim or written allegation of fraud; or (e) a Proceeding involving any license that the Contractor is required to possess in order to perform under this Contract.

14. Living Wage. The Contractor must comply with Living Wage requirements based upon the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines to the extent applicable to this Contract. This figure is calculated every February by the Federal Government and is released in late February or March. The City of Eastpointe shall not enter into any service contract with any Contractor who does not demonstrate that it pays its work force a Living Wage as defined in the Codified Ordinances of the City of Eastpointe Chapter 213, Ordinance No. 901.

The Contractor shall certify annually that it is following the Living Wage Ordinance.

15. Governing Law. This Contract is governed, construed, and enforced in accordance with Michigan law, and all claims relating to or arising out of this Contract are governed by Michigan law.

The dispute will be referred to the parties’ respective Contract Administrators, Program Managers. Such referral must include a description of the issues and all supporting documentation. The parties must submit the dispute to the City Manager if unable to resolve the dispute within 15 business days. The parties will continue performing while a dispute is being resolved, unless the dispute precludes performance. A dispute involving payment does not preclude performance.

Litigation to resolve the dispute will not be instituted until after the dispute has been elevated to the City Manager and either concludes that resolution is unlikely or fails to respond within 15 business days. The parties are not prohibited from instituting formal proceedings: (a) to avoid the expiration of statute of limitations period; (b) to preserve a superior position with respect to creditors; or (c) where a party decides that a temporary restraining order or other injunctive relief is the only adequate remedy. This Section does not limit the City’s right to terminate the Contract.

20. Media Releases. News releases (including promotional literature and commercial advertisements) pertaining to the Contract or project to which it relates must not be made without prior written City approval, and then only in accordance with the explicit written instructions of the City.

21. Severability.

The remaining Contract will continue in full force and effect.

22. Waiver. Failure to enforce any provision of this Contract will not constitute a waiver.

23. Force Majeure. Neither party will be in breach of this Contract because of any failure arising from any disaster or acts of god that are beyond their reasonable control and without their fault or negligence. Each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance. The Contractor will not be relieved of a breach or delay caused by its subcontractors. If immediate performance is necessary to ensure public health and safety, the City may immediately contract with a third party.

24. Entire Agreement and Order of Precedence.
This Contract, which includes the Bid Specifications and Bid Forms, and schedules and exhibits which are hereby expressly incorporated, is the entire agreement of the parties related to the Contract Activities.
